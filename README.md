# Movies Recommender System using Machine Learning
 

This project implements a personalized movie recommender system using machine learning algorithms. It leverages user ratings and movie metadata to suggest relevant movies based on individual preferences. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to generate accurate recommendations.

Key features include:

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on user similarity.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies with similar characteristics (genres, directors, etc.).
Hybrid Model: Combines both approaches for better results.
